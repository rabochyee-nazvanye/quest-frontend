# Developing

## Theming

We support custom Antd themes in project.

Custom themes rest in `src/themes` folder as `.less` files and get compiled to `.css` before the runtime.

After that they simply are injected in the public html with a switch that changes the order of the injected styles when toggled

### Compile Ant themes

`npx gulp less`

### Create own Ant theme

1. Create the file in `src/themes/*-theme.less`
2. Tweak the file using [AntD theme customization tutorial](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme)
3. Compile themes

### Tweak existing Ant theme

1. Tweak the existing theme
2. Recompile themes

### Custom styles

> Better to stick to the Ant components when possible, and use Ant less variables where possible. Writing custom visual-related css is not recommended.

We use [react-css-theme-switcher](https://github.com/JoseRFelix/react-css-theme-switcher#readme) to handle the changing of the css theme. Please refer to it when styling own components.
